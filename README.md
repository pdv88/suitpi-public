## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Notes

This app requires a MySQL database, a `.env` file with various API keys and credentials, and webhook configurations for Stripe. Due to the complexity of local setup and deactivated scraping functionality (due to IMPI's anti-bot protection), the app may not run fully without additional configuration.

For security reasons, this is a cleaned version of the original private repo. The scraping code, Stripe billing, and reporting logic are all present, but may require adjustments to run locally.
